Advanced Web 2 Group Project 1

Our group had major issues working with GitHub. We attribute this to being unfamiliar with working ona group coding project together. After trying to resolve the problem on our owm, we contacted our professor who explained the problem and proper procedures. This will undoubtably help with out GitHub use in the future.

(SeltzerFan24) Stanley's challenges: It took me a while to get a handle on some of the more complicated Bootstrap layout aspects on the homepage, which was a problem I solved with Bootstrap documentation. I also had difficulty with the backgreound image on about.html which requried some trial and error with background image properties. I coded the navigation, the homepage, the catering page, and the about page. 

(nicolelmke) Lemke's Challenges: My only challenge when coding was overcoming bootstraps styling. On the location page I found it difficult to make my vision from the mockup come to life to the T. With a little work of media querys and background images I was able to get it to work. As said before our group had major problems with git hub. I continued to have them even after you (Lee) helped us get back on track. I'm still not totally sure why we were having so many problems. I coded the index page and location page, as will as put together the frames.

Lacayo Challenges: This was our first time using GitHub and as a group we had a lot of different issues to sort out. It was definitely a challenge but overall a learning experience. I had some difficulty getting the Bootstrap to cooperate with footer. There were definitely some challenges from the hero/background images to losing progress with GitHub pull/push issues but all of this will help me in the future while coding with others!
