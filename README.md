Need help with GitHub or LESS?

Push Branches:
    create branch after cloning repo from GitHub
    create branch using terminal: git branch lastname-branch
    switch to your branch: git checkout lastname-branch
    make desired changes to code
    push to GitHub: git push -u origin lastname-branch

Pull Repo to Your Branch:
    use terminal to make sure you're on lastname-branch
    terminal command: git pull

Using Node to compile LESS: 
    use terminal in VSCode (pull terminal up from the bottom of the screen)
    type "lessc less/main.less css/styles.css" without the quotation marks each time you wish to update the CSS file

There is no project requirement to compile this way, use Koala if you like!
